# 🌌 My Galaxy

Personal and academic portfolio bringing together projects developed for learning, experimentation, and continuous improvement in software development. This repository is structured to ensure clarity, organization, and ease of navigation, reflecting an ongoing journey in programming, problem-solving, and software design.

## 📚 Repository Categories

- **Activities & Studies**  
  Programming logic exercises (such as Beecrowd challenges), algorithms, and small projects developed during courses and academic studies.

- **Ideas & Prototypes**  
  Experimental tools, automation scripts, and early-stage solutions for everyday problems, currently under testing and refinement.

- **Games**  
  Small game projects created to practice logic, basic physics concepts, and graphical interfaces.

- **Tools & Utilities**  
  Open-source utilities and practical tools intended for long-term maintenance and evolution.

## 🛠️ Technologies

The main technologies used throughout this repository include:

- **Java** — Programming logic and back-end development
- **Python** — Automation and data-related tasks
- **JavaScript** — Web development and simple game mechanics
- **SQL** — Database modeling and data structuring

## 📁 Repository Structure

All projects follow a consistent and organized directory structure:

```
.
├── activities/          # Programming challenges (Beecrowd, LeetCode, etc.)
├── games/               # Interactive projects and games
├── tools/               # Scripts and utility tools
└── studies/             # Course notes and mini-projects
```

## 🚀 Continuous Development

This repository is under continuous development. Software is never truly finished; it evolves through refactoring, optimization, and continuous learning.

Feedback, suggestions, and discussions are always welcome!
