🌌 My Galaxy
📌 Overview

This repository serves as a personal and academic portfolio, gathering projects developed for learning, experimentation, and continuous improvement in software development.
It is structured to provide clarity, organization, and ease of navigation.

The content reflects my ongoing journey in programming, problem-solving, and software design.

📁 Repository Categories

The projects are organized into the following categories:

🎓 Activities & Studies
Programming logic exercises (such as Beecrowd challenges), algorithms, and small projects developed during courses and academic studies.

💡 Ideas & Prototypes
Experimental tools, automation scripts, and early-stage solutions for everyday problems, currently under testing and refinement.

🎮 Games
Small game projects created to practice logic, basic physics concepts, and graphical interfaces.

🛠️ Tools & Utilities
Open-source utilities and practical tools intended for long-term maintenance and evolution.

🛠️ Technologies

The main technologies used throughout this repository include:

Java — Focused on programming logic and back-end development

Python — Automation and data-related tasks

JavaScript — Web development and simple game mechanics

SQL — Database modeling and data structuring

📂 Repository Structure

To maintain consistency and organization, projects follow this structure:

/
├── activities/          # Programming challenges (e.g., Beecrowd, LeetCode)
├── games/               # Interactive projects and games
├── tools/               # Scripts and utility tools
└── studies/             # Course notes and mini-projects

📈 Continuous Development

This repository is under continuous development.
I believe that software is never truly finished, but rather constantly refined through refactoring, optimization, and learning.

Feedback, suggestions, and discussions are always welcome.
